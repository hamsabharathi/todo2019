A to-do list for mini project BR

Create a minimal clone of Trello/Kanban https://trello.com/ Board using React & Redux.

Expected working features –

1. Multiple board management (Assume one is already created)

2. Add/delete lists in a board

3. Add/delete/update cards (or issues). Card must containe a title and description

4. Use drag & drop feature to move cards across lists.

Explore redux principles, best practices, different types of components (HOC, presentational components). Also retain app’s state on refresh, use local browser storage to rehydrate app state (use middleware). Learn how to use Redux extension (No need to integrate with a backend service, use local cache to retain state)
